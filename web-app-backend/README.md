# Swozo web-server

## Local development

For now running server via Intellij is recommended. Server should be available at `localhost:5000`.

### API

We use Swagger(Open API) for documentation and code generation.
To see autogenerated documentation open http://localhost:5000/swagger-ui/index.html.

With server working run `yarn gen` in frontend main directory to generate typescript stubs.
